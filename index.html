					<aside class="notes">Law is also used on other things. P is low level perceptual discrimination, I is the intensity of the stimulus. k can be found through experimentation. </aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Why are loops effective?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Exposure effect</li>
						<li>Expectation</li>
						<li>Shifting attention</li>
						<li>Transformation</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>Exposure effect - you start to develop an affinity for stuff you are repeatedly exposed to</li>
						<li>Expectation - your brain starts anticipating what comes next. When it happens and it's right, you get some level of satisfaction from that.</li>
						<li>Shifting attention - on each cycle, you examine a different portion of the song or image. It helps us notice differences and patterns over time.</li>
						<li>Transformation - something ordinary becomes something else. If you repeatedly hear a certain voice, for example, it may begin to sound like singing or music or melody. It actually works.</li>
					</ul>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>More on storytelling</h2>
					<img src="img/Minard.png">

					<aside class="notes">Robert Kosara. Stories are effective for similar reasons. They have a format, we are used to seeing stories everywhere. Stories make people pay attention. We remember this viz because of the story it tells. You want to tell stories whenever you are looking for attention, or when you want to stick to memory - this is very important for visualizations that are seeking to influence someone into making a certain decision, spend money, etc.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Zeigarnik effect</h2>
					<p>This is why cliffhangers work.</p>
					<img src="img/hibbert.jpg">

					<aside class="notes">Not that you have to make your data visualizations cliffhangers. But it's an effective tool in keeping people's attention. I mean, I really wanna see who shot Mr. Burns!</aside>

					<h2>Make the audience feel.</h2>
					<img src="img/hand.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">Nigel Holmes points out this is a great ad. Explains the steps - do this, try to lift finger, that's what it's like to feel paralyzed. Try to make your work make the person feel the emotions that you’re trying to convey.</aside>

					<blockquote>I hope you're aware that you invited the person whose work Tufte called <strong>chartjunk</strong>.</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Nigel Holmes worked as graphics director for Time Magazine for 16 years and has written eight books on aspects of information design. He has a bit of a grudge against Tufte for taking this image out of context and, in tiny font, saying 'used with permission' where he had not. Contempt, eh?</aside>

					<aside class="notes">Nigel Holmes worked as graphics director for Time Magazine for 16 years and has written eight books on aspects of information design. He finds that no matter the medium, what's common for all visualization is that it tries to connect to a person. He finds the best way to do this is to make the other person smile.</aside>

					<img class="fragment" src="img/cash.png">
					<aside class="notes">He finds the best way to do this is to make the other person smile - not necessarily ha ha funny, but with recognition about something. So he tries to be friendly, approachable, and tap into people's emotions. He got called upon to redesign the US currency and he went all out.</aside>

					<h2>"Now I see it!"</h2>
					<img src="img/interferon.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">Nigel. The best thing an information designer can hear. This graphic was printed in 1979 and it is about how the primary HepC treatment, interferon, works. The academic he was working with was apoplectic when he saw Nigel's sketch. "You're reducing my work on interferon to a CARTOON?" Yes.
					Within a week he wrote to Nigel saying "Thank You - I've gotten so many letters from people saying 'I finally understand what you do'."</aside>

					<aside class="notes">But this debate's been going on for awhile. It's been upended by touchscreens. Touchscreens are actually nice on our brains - our finger touches the screen and we can really imagine moving the text up and down. However, using a mouse or trackpad, our brain has to map moving horizontally to a vertical screen.</aside>

					<h2>The 12 principles</h2>

					<iframe class="stretch" src="http://the12principles.tumblr.com/"></iframe>

					<aside class="notes">The 12 basic principles of animation were developed by the ‘old men’ of Walt Disney Studios, amongst them Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, during the 1930s. Of course they weren’t old men at the time, but young men who were at the forefront of exciting discoveries that were contributing to the development of a new art form. These principles came as a result of reflection about their practice and through Disney’s desire to use animation to express character and personality.
					This gallery is a personal take on those principles, applied to simple shapes. Like a cube.

					<aside class="notes">Tween.js is a super simple, fast and easy to use tweening engine which incorporates optimised Robert Penner's equations. This is a Minesweeper game created with it.</aside>

					<aside class="notes">Two.js is a two-dimensional drawing API. It is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to draw in multiple contexts: svg, canvas, and webgl. This example moves the point on the curve when you mouse horizontally.</aside>
